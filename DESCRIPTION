Description: The 'fastpeRmute' package offers a collection of efficient functions 
    for generating combinations and permutations, both with and without repetition.
    Engineered for performance, the underlying implementation leverages C++.
    These functions provide a significant speed boost 
    compared to the respective base R functions, making it ideal for computation-intensive tasks.
